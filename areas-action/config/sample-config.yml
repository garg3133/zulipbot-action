# Sample config for area-labels action.

# All the features are disabled by default. So, you need to
# mention all the features/configs you wish to use, in your
# configuration file and skip the features/config you do not
# wish to use.

# A dictionary matching area labels (specified as keys) to
# team slugs (specified as values).
area_labels:
  "area: api": "server-api"
  "area: authentication": "server-authentication"
  "area: bots": "server-bots"

# Whether or not to automatically copy the area labels
# from an issue to the PRs linked to that issue (and thus,
# notify the respective area teams of that PR).
#
# Note: This only works if the PR is linked to an issue
# using the keywords (linked below) in the PR description
# or commit messages. It currently does not consider the
# issues linked manually due to the limitations of GitHub
# API.
